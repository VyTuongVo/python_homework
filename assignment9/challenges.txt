Describe any challenges you faced in completing this assignment and how you resolved them

    - For me, the biggest problems was navigating the complicated elements. It was dififult to locate the link (xpath) to get to the result. Espically since the element have so much layers. I find the going through steps by steps slowly and making to pay attention to the highlighted area is very important. Addition, I find learning about the  <a> and other indentifcation a bit challenging. However, when I get the concept of it, the ideology really helps me to navigate the element page.
